MindHub 2. Insider Open Government web site with live data API is published at https://martinvedani.github.io/InSider_Open_Gob_Web_Site/.


In this module, I was a developer at Code of the Web, a small software shop that creates custom JavaScript-based web applications. Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF), a non-partisan non-profit organization working to increase the publicâ€™s involvement in government, hired me to develop a Congressional tracking web site for them. I worked on this web application using modern JavaScript technologies, including AJAX, JSON, and RESTful APIs.

To do this, I worked through a series of tasks designed by experts in programming and web app development to help me create a robust and useful web application, specifically:

i.) JavaScript and sophisticated JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery and AngularJS

ii.) AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to communicate directly with web services from a web page

iii.) JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to encode complex data in a portable compact human-readable format

iv.) RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs (Application Program Interfaces) to standardize the messages used to get JSON objects with AJAX calls
